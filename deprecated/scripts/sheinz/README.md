* First incantation of Heinz using shell script!

No value whatsoever today, just here for fun and historical purposes.

IIRC, the required stream had to be loaded manually in the favourites
menu, and hotkeys would go to each of the auxiliary shell scripts that
would call the main script with the right parameters.

It wasn't used much, even by me, for obvious reasons, but it was a
nice PoC.
