* e2m3u2bouquet/Suls mods

These are currently mods against Suls v0.7.6 and v0.7.7

https://github.com/su1s/e2m3u2bouquet/releases/tag/v0.7.6
https://github.com/su1s/e2m3u2bouquet/releases/tag/v0.7.7

They generally enable catchup markings (!!!) on supported
channels/providers, fix some VOD matching issues across
different providers' m3u, and do picon file name replacements
properly.

* Pick the version appropriate mod Python file (NOTE: you need
to download from github as RAW!)
* Rename it to e2m3u2bouquet.py
* Drop it on your plugins/E2m3u2bouquet Suls plugin directory
(typically /usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/E2m3u2bouquet)
* Restart the GUI/Enigma2/box.

On the next bouquet update, changes will take effect.
