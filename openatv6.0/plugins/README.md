NOTE: currently these plugins are provider specific (Vaders+resellers); if you have a multi provider configuration, and you activate the plugin on another provider stream, there's a chance you'll be leaking your other providers' credentials to Vaders.


Thanks to the folks in PMC:Enigma (namely @falleen, @BillHicks, @Bill) and DeathStar (namely @agentsmith1, @SomeKewlName).

Although dev/tested in Open ATV 6.0, these plugins were reported to also work in:

Open ATV 6.2 (@corkman, @falleen)

OpenViX 5.1.x (@SomeKewlName)

WooshBuild v? (@BillHicks)
