* e2m3u2bouquet/Suls mods

These are currently mods against 0.7.5 version on
https://github.com/su1s/e2m3u2bouquet/releases/tag/v0.7.5

- Mark catchup supporting channels (!!!)
- Fix VOD for Vaders (this was provided by Suls folks, thanks!)
- Do both.

Just rename the chosen mod Python file to e2m3u2bouquet.py and drop
it on your plugins/E2m3u2bouquet Suls plugin directory, then restart
the GUI/Enigma2/box.

On the next bouquet update, changes will take effect.
