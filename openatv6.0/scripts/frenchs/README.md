* Old script to mark catchup supporting channels in bouquets.

No value whatsoever today, just here for fun and historical purposes.

This required a file (or files) to be created containing the name of
the catchup supporting channels/streams, one per line. In the old
days, this was generated by Heinz, for a particular provider, but
not anymore.
